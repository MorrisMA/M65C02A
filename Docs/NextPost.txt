The following diagram provides a view of the M65C02A microcomputer that I've using to test the core. Neither the external memory interface nor the timer module are fully developed at this time; the external memory interface has been used for debug rather than for test programs. All programs written to date use the internal block RAMs as shown in the diagram.

The following two diagrams provide the Programming Model views for the M65C02A core in the 6502/65C02 compatibility mode and the extended capabilities mode.

I continue to work on a comprehensive MS Word User Guide, but I've attached the document in its current form for those who may be interested. A lot of work remains. I've edited, re-edited large sections of the document. It's surprising how difficult writing a clear and coherent user guide for the M65C02A has been and continues to be. Virtually every time I open the document, I find something that needs to be added, clarified, or simply deleted. A lot more remains to be added, and I'll be working on that while I turn my attention to porting fig-FORTH, EhBasic, and possibly developing a simulator for the M65C02A.
